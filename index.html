                    <h2>FASHION IN AN AGE OF TECHNOLOGY</h2>
                    <p>The aim of the exhibition is to demonstrate the correlation between the hand(manus) and the machine(machine) which work in tandem at advancing the future of fashion. Focus is on execution of high fashion and ready-to-wear, the former which involves singular outfits fitted for a specific individual; the latter are multiple production for mass standard sizes to fit various body types. </p>
                    <p>At this day and age, handmade and machine-made practice lends a useful tool to designers and manufacturers alike that will continue its collaboration to a new age of fashion technology and textile advancement. </p>
                    <p>Here are three of my favorite pieces from the exhibit which will hopefully provide a guide for your visit at the Metropolitan Musuem of Art.</p>
