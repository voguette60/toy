                    <p>Dress</p>
                    <p>Spring/Summer 2010-11, haute couture</p>
                    <p>Polyamide, acrylic, leather. Collaborated with New York company .MGX by
                       Materialise and artist Daniel Widrig, inspired by the transformation of liquid
                       into crystals.</p>
                    <p>When you look at the first (3-D- printed)piece I made, you can see the fine lines
                       of the print. You can see how the piece has been built up. In one millimeter,
                       there are up to ten lines. It's almost like a fingerprint-it's as detailed as
                       your fingerprint.... It was inspired by the way limestone deposits form shells.
                       With 3-D printing. I am very much drawn to the organic."</p>
